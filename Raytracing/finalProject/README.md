This is the final verison of the ray tracer implemented in java:

It does not need any external packages to run, hence just copy the code to any java editor and it will be ready to run.

The code will output the ray traced image of three main large spheres sourrounded by many smaller spheres that have both thier location and color, and some attribues randomized.
