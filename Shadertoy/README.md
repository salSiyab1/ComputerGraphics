This is an implementation of the raytracer done previously, but in GLSL, you can run this code in shadertoy.com

To expand on what exactly is present in the output it is a bunch of spheres that are outputted with different reflectivity, refractivity, and other attributes of the spheres, and backbone for outputting this image is raytracing
